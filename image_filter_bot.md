# Image Filter Bot
---

**Project description:** As a personal project I developed a Discord bot to recognize if an image contains nudity or not. If the image scores high enough to be unsafe, the image is deleted and the user who sent it receives a message.

### Key Features
* Programmed in JavaScript and Python using Visual Studio Code
* Used async/await functions

Code available upon request

## Personal Project
This helped deepen my understanding of Node.js and JavaScript. I explored ways of working with data extracted from Discords API.
