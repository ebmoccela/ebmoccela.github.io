**Project description:** My group and I developed a real-time multiplayer player card game. Using a standard deck, each player lays a card onto the pile looking for pairs. If a pair is found the first player to slap wins the pile. Exceptions are face cards, faces require the opposing player to lay the face value equivalent of cards down or until another face value is found or until a match is found. HTML and JavaScript were used.

### Key Features
* Programmed in JavaScript using Brackets
* Used Node.js and socket.io to communicate between clients and server
* Debug asynchronous functions
* Deployed project to Heroku

## Software Engineering II Class
This course gave me the opportunity to work with a group on projects and work with new technologies I wasn't familiar with. We learned how to divide work, assist each other, plan and take on new challenges.
